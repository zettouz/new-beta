This is a Tackle system, designed for FiveM, it does not require ESX or VRP, feel free to use this, and change it how you like, just put InfiniteRP in your ReadMe as credited :)

Originally scripted by SuigetsuShinso for Infinite RP
With Similarities to Scott_UK's Tackle System. (https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-tackle-system/95129)

While sprinting, press E to tackle another player.

Can also sprint, jump, then tackle.

Can also crouch, sprint, then tackle as well.

Simple as that.
